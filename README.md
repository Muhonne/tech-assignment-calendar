# Implementation
Is in calendar-widget/ folder. It's a Next.js project set up with `npx create-next-app@latest calendar-widget`
Check the readme there for more details but to get started with dev:
- Have node and npm
- `cd calendar-widget`
- `npm i`
- `npm run dev`
- to run unit tests `npm run test`
- server-side debugging set up with vs code

## Design details
- The whole implementation relies on the month table being a 2d matrix with weeks and days (might be simpler to flatten into one array for setting the program).
- Some comments added to improve readability as the code related to matrix indexes is what it is
- There is a fair bit of looping and this is the first draft so there may be performance improvements to be made but I tried to avoid looping things more than once.
- Test coverage needs improvement but core logic appears to work
- There is a bit of a playgound for manipulating data/props in index.tsx, have at it
- some assumptions were made, comments added where applicable
- No copilot was used. ChatGPT was used to generate some types from json and tests.
- Overall the code is now in a state where I would ask for comments and continue to improve tests.

# Frontend Assignment

Your assignment is to make an app that displays 3-week treatment program. Treatment program used as input is described in JSON file and the desired output is presented in a design.

## Input Format

Example input for the 3-week treatment program is located in [examples/program.json](examples/program.json). The input has the following format:

```json
{
  "week<number>": [{
    "weekday": "MONDAY" || "TUESDAY" || "WEDNESDAY" || "THURSDAY" || "FRIDAY" || "SATURDAY" || "SUNDAY",
    "title": "Title for the daily activity",
    "completed": true || false
  }, ...]
}
```

Input contains three weeks. Each week contains multiple activities. Each activity has three fields: `weekday` indicates the day of week for the activity, `title` is a short description of the daily activity and `completed` indicates whether the user has done the activity.

## Output Design

![](examples/design.png)

Treatment program is visualised on a calendar. The calendar is always displaying current ongoing month and displays today as active with a different background color (14th in the picture above).

The treatment program starts on the first full week of the month and continues for three weeks. The activity of the day is displayed under the day number. The day number will have different color depending on whether it has an activity or not.

If a user has not completed an activity in the past, the activity will be moved to the current day. There can be only one activity per day. Thus if there are multiple incomplete activities in the past, the first incomplete activity will be displayed today, the second tomorrow, and so forth. For the previous days only completed activities will be displayed.

Your app should match the design in the picture above using the following specs:

### Colors

* Black: `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.8)`
* Green: `rgb(93, 175, 116)`
* White: `rgb(255, 255, 255)`

### Text Styles

* `h1` [Fjalla One 700](https://fonts.google.com/?query=Fjalla+One) `48px / 1.3`
* `h2` [Libre Franklin 700](https://fonts.google.com/?query=Libre+Franklin) `64px`
* `h3` [Libre Franklin 400](https://fonts.google.com/?query=Libre+Franklin) `10px / 1.2`
* `th` [Work Sans 700](https://fonts.google.com/?query=Work+Sans) `16px`

## Tech

Assignment must use React. Otherwise feel free to use any tools and 3rd party libraries you like.

## Delivering

Make a pull request of your assignment and leave it open when you are done :slightly_smiling_face:

You should at least update the `README.md` with installation and running instructions. Also consider how you demonstrate that your app is working as intended.

**Remember to check that you have committed all required files and instructions before submitting the pull request** :white_check_mark: Good way to check this is to clone the repository into different folder and follow the instructions you have written to run the app.

***You have the option to receive a compensation of 120 â‚¬ (gross salary) for the work on this test project by providing your tax card and your bank account IBAN number. If you are interested in this option, please let us know via email me when you submit your solution.***
